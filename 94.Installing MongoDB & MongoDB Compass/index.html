<!-- mongo db is a document based database . it has java script like syntax -->

<!-- mySQL us also same DB.(but will not learn it )
 and it is a relational database (ie. A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another)-->
<!-- all the data base have their own pros and cons -->

<!-- database : A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system -->


<!-- install the mongoDB community version form the net and add new connetion
(ie. creation of server instances and put its adress url ) -->

<!-- 1. we write the mongoBD code in the mongo shell of mongoDB compass

2. if I write "show dataBases" the all the data base list will appear in a list

3. make a data base by connecting and name DBs name as sigma and collection name as "courses"

4. go to add data--then--insert data (here we can add data and persit it)(persists means storing data)

note:In Mongo data we can persist data i.e even if we close the compass at some time and then reopen it then we will find the same condition of compass as it was at closing of compass

5. "show databases" command will show all the data bases along with their storage size

6. "use sigma(database name) " is used to switch to the sigma DB 

7. db.courses.find():
     courses ke andar mujhe saare documents de do

8. db.courses.insertOne({name : "javascript"})
  this will insert a instance = name : "javascript"

9. install the extension "monogoDB for VScode" aur extension icon ke neeche ek patta a jeyega
     -click "add connection"
     -and connect it
     - now jo kam hum compass pr kr rhe the they can be done on here
     - all the documents can be seen here and modified here(like writing a code in JS)
     

     -now click "create new playground"
     -here we will get a script where we can perform insert,delete, etc
